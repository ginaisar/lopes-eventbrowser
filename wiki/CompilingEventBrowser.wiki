#summary Describes how to compile the program.

_Note: Even though QT is a cross-platform library and there exists ROOT for Windows, Lopes-Eventbrowser is only tested on the Linux platform with GCC._

First, make sure the external library dependencies are satisfied. The requirements can be found [LibraryDependency here].

Then refer to the [http://code.google.com/p/lopes-eventbrowser/source/browse/trunk/COMPILE COMPILE] file in the source directory for details.
