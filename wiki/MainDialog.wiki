===Tabbed interface===

On the left, the canvases are shown in a columns; on top of the column there are buttons to add, remove and rename canvas. By clicking a name in the column, the corresponding canvas should show up on the right. 

By right clicking on the various parts (such as the axis, the title, the plots, etc.), you can have access to some ROOT function to modify the attributes of the graph such as color, marker type, etc.:

The apply a cut, enter a cut in the textbox and click "Apply Cut". If you click "Save Cut", the event cut in the textbox will be saved, and you will be able to access by finding in the drop-down list "Saved cuts". Additionally, the entries in "Saved cuts" are saved in a file called eventcuts.txt so that next time the program starts the saved cuts are recovered. See ConfigSettingFiles, section eventcuts.txt for more explanation.

By clicking the "View Data" button, you will be directed to a new dialog which contains a table that shows the data in the ROOT tree. See ViewDataInRootTree for more information.

===Graphing options===

At the top of this part you will find a drop-down list of the graph types available, and by selecting one of the options you will be shown various input boxes to enter information. See GraphingExamples for more information on each of the graph types.

===Quick options===

Here you have two options:
 # Draw in new tabbed window: by checking this checkbox, each time you click the button "Draw", a new tab will be created automatically for you containing the new graph. If the checkbox is not checked, the button "Draw" will draw and overwrite the current canvas.
 # Draw multiple graphs on the same canvas: by checking this checkbox, each time you click the button "Draw", the graph will be drawn on top of the current canvas; if the checkbox is unchecked, the current canvas is by default erased before the new graph is drawn.

===Status bar===
On the left is some information about the status of the program; on the left, the current number of events is shown.
