====*Q: Why is the labels are oversized, placed in wrong positions, or in general ugly looking?*====
A: Likely you don't have some fonts installed. Check the console window where you started the program to see if ROOT issued some warnings like
{{{
`The font "symbol.ttf" was not installed yet
 Substitute it with "Arial"
 Make sure your local "~/.fonts.conf" or "/etc/fonts/fonts.conf" file points to "$ROOOTSYS/fonts" directory to get the proper support for ROOT TLatex class`
}}}

====*Q: Why do I get messages like "sorry, this is not implemented"?*====
A: Well, as the message says, the feature you try to use is not implemented. Maybe it will be some time in the future...
